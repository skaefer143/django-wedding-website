                            This is also a highly recommended and often more affordable option for those who don't mind something a bit more self-service.

                <h3>Things to Do</h3>
                <p>There's no shortage of things to do in Edmonton! Some ideas are listed below.</p>
                <h4>Chillin at Storm's House</h4>
                <p>
                    My brothers are pretty good entertainment I guess. Please shovel our walks for us!
                </p>
                <h4>Chillin at Elise's House</h4>
                <p>
                    Elise's family can get pretty rowdy when playing overcooked, or right before people are coming over, so feel free to pop by unannounced!
                </p>

                <h4>Golf</h4>
                <p>Plenty of scenic <a href="http://www.notlgolf.com/index.html">golf options</a> around town, many of them using the same grounds for vines as for courses.</p>
                <h4>Spa</h4>
                <p>Two of the nicest hotels in town host relaxing spas: Secret Garden Spa at Prince of Wales and 100 Fountain Spa at Pillar and Post.</p>
                <h4>Shopping</h4>
                <p>
                    There is a long tradition of Americans flocking to Canada for discount shopping and Canadians flocking to America for the same.
                    In addition to a variety of outlet malls on both sides of the border, Niagara-on-the-Lake town also features a very quaint downtown with lots of unique shops.
                </p>
                <h4>Theater</h4>
                <p>
                    The Shaw theater festival will be taking place in NOTL this weekend, producing the works of Bernard Shaw and Shavian playwrights.
                    Theaters are located in NOTL town.
                </p>
                <h4>Buffalo Wings</h4>
                <p>
                    Probably not worth a dedicated trip, but Buffalo NY is the hometown of buffalo wings.
                    So if you’re driving through anyways, might be a chance to pay homage.
                </p>
                <h4>Botanical Gardens</h4>
                <p>Some people like flowers. If you’re one of them, <a href="http://www.niagaraparks.com/niagara-falls-attractions/botanical-gardens.html">go here</a>. There’s even a butterfly conservatory.</p>
                <h4>Eat</h4>
                <p>
                    Great meals can be found at <a href="http://www.thegarrisonhouse.ca/#!home/mainPage">Garrison House</a>, <a href="http://www.treadwellcuisine.com/">Treadwell</a>, and <a href="http://backhouse.xyz/">Backhouse</a>.

                </p>

                <p><a href="http://www.silversmithbrewing.com/">Silversmith Brewing</a> is an excellent local artisanal brewery offering offbeat new drinks.</p>
                <p>Some informal later-night options include The Olde Angel Inn, Sandtrap, and the Irish Harp.</p>
                <h4>Celebrate Canada Day!</h4>
                <p>
                    On Friday night, July 1st, from the Southern banks of Lake Ontario on the north side of NOTL town, you will be able to see the fireworks light up across Toronto, Hamilton, and Niagara.
                </p>
                <h4>Celebrate America Day!</h4>
                <p>God knows what those Americans do. Have a BBQ?</p>
